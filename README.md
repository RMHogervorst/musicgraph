Basic overview of the project

\[x\] First I build the scaffolding for api calls I will use the same thing I did for cortical.io, read .Renviron for a key or ask for a key.

The basic idea is to connect to the graphsearch api, not the other pieces. I will make some pieces that connect and keep as many things open. So that you can construct a query without much interference from R. My idea is to have a query field like "prefix=gree&genre=rock" that you can fill yourself. I might add functions on top that would fill in some of those fields for you.

Every endpoint has the option to fill in parameters or use `query` to type it yourself.

The graphsearch consists of Artist, Album and Track.

\[\] build something that takes into acoount the rate limiting. \[x\] function that translates the result into a data.frame \[\] check limit when given between 1 and 100

You will usually have to do multiple calls. Searching for artist returns an ID and the ID can then be used on the artists metadata.
