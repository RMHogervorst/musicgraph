#' Getting your api key
#'
#' It took me a while to find out how you get your api key. So I wrote this
#' little documentation. For every request you will need an api key. The good
#' thing is, that you can register on \link{https://developer.musicgraph.com}
#' and for most uses you can use the key for free. There is a rate limit of
#' 50 calls per minute.
#'
#' @section instructions on how to find the key
#' - create an account
#' - log in
#' - go to dashboard
#' - click on applications
#' - fill in some details about the app. (if you like)
#'
#' See the excelent documentation
